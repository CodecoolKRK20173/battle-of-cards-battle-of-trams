I want to play battle of cards:

- I want trams and Cracow. I love trams and Cracow:)
- Play with other human or a computer
- Make me choose number of players, let it be 2-4
- Deal cards equally among all players
- Each player should see only his first card 
- Each player should see how many cards have left among the other players
- There should be 4 characteristics on each card
- Player should call one characteristic from his card and compare it with other players
- Player with highest value of characteristic takes all cards which was involved in battle
- When ther is a tie, cards which was involved in battle are putted aside and are taken by winner in next round
- If any of players runs out of cards the game ends
- Player with the most cards wins
