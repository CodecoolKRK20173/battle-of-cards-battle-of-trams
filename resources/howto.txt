Each player can see only the top card. The player to the left of the dealer choose out any one of the four
specifications on the card: travelTime (Time), zulCount (Å»ule), driverRudeness (MRF) or kanarCount (Kanary).
The other players checks out out the same specification from their top cards. The player with the highest value 
takes the top card from the other players (including his own), and puts them at the bottom of his cards.
