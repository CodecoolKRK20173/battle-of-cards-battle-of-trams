#### BATTLE OF CARDS


##### Requirements
- Select a ​theme ​for your card game​. A few popular choices are cars, fighter jets, dinosaurs, football teams, actors, etc. Use your imagination!
- Define your game’s rules​. How many players? How many cards dealt per players? Do you want to allow bets?
- Model your game​ using interfaces, classes, etc.
- Use abstraction, inheritance, composition and encapsulation​ where applicable.
- Implement the Comparable ​interface and create and use a Comparator ​implementation at least once.
- Implement the hashCode ​and equals ​methods at least on one class.
- Implement toString​ on classes where it makes sense to pretty print them to the terminal.
- Print to the standard output ​only​ in a single place in your application​ (see printStatistics in Step 4).
- Use the Collections framework​ for your implementation.
- Use Git​ to version your application’s source code - commit frequently and small, well-defined changes.
- Create a Main class, with a main method.
